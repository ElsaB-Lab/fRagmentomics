\title{Extract sequence and quality between two read indices}
\usage{
get_base_basq_from_read_at_pos(pos_cur, pos_pre, read_stats)
}
\arguments{
\item{pos_cur}{current position request}

\item{pos_pre}{previous position request}

\item{read_stats}{A list of read-level statistics.}
}
\value{
A list with the base and the quality of the read aligning with the position provided. If the read contains a
deletion, base is set to '-' and the quality to an empty string.
}
\description{
Extracts the read sequence and base qualities corresponding to the region between two read indices,
which are derived from genomic positions.
