\title{Extract allele, quality, and mutation status from a read}
\usage{
get_base_basq_mstat_from_read(
  chr,
  pos,
  ref,
  alt,
  read_stats,
  fasta_fafile = NULL,
  fasta_seq = NULL,
  cigar_free_indel_match = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chr}{Character vector representing the chromosome of interest.}

\item{pos}{Numeric value representing the Genomic position of interest.}

\item{ref}{Character vector representing reference base(s).}

\item{alt}{Character vector representing alternative base(s).}

\item{read_stats}{A list of read-level statistics.}

\item{fasta_fafile}{An open connection to an object of class FaFile}

\item{fasta_seq}{A list with the fasta sequence between two positions.}

\item{cigar_free_indel_match}{Boolean. If activated, the information from the CIGAR is disregarded when determining the
mutation status of a read for indel. Instead the mutation status is determined by comparing the sequence of the read
to the sequence of the wild-type reference and the mutated reference. Activating this option may lead to discordant
genotyping of reads compared to the information provided by the CIGAR for indels. On the other hand, when
activated, it may rescue mutated genotypes for indel that would be missed in cases where the representation of the
indel in the CIGAR does not match the norm of bcftools of the mutation being analyzed.}
}
\value{
A list containing "base", "basq", "mstat".
}
\description{
This function serves as a primary parser for a single read at a variant locus. It determines if the
read covers the variant, extracts the observed sequence and its base qualities, and assigns a detailed mutation status.
