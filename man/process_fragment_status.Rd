\title{Process Fragment Status
This function determines the mutation status of a DNA fragment based on
the mutation type and read information. It supports (SNV), insertions,
and deletions.}
\usage{
process_fragment_status(alt, mutation_type, r_info_base1, r_info_base2)
}
\arguments{
\item{alt}{Character vector representing alternative base(s).}

\item{mutation_type}{In "SNV", "deletion", or "insertion".}

\item{r_info_base1}{A character string or NA indicating the base or
mutation detection status from the first read.}

\item{r_info_base2}{A character string or NA indicating the base or
mutation detection status from the second read.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the fragment status:
-"MUT": Both reads support the mutation /
(or at least one read supports it when coverage is incomplete).
-"WT_but_other_read_mut": Both reads cover the position but only
one supports the mutation.
-"WT": Neither read supports the mutation.
