Description: A user-friendly R package that enables the characterization
    of each cfDNA fragment overlapping one or multiple mutations of interest,
    starting from a sequencing file containing aligned reads (BAM file).
    fRagmentomics supports multiple mutation input formats (e.g., VCF, TSV,
    or string “chr:pos:ref:alt” representation), accommodates one-based and
    zero-based genomic conventions, handles mutation representation ambiguities,
    and accepts any reference file and species in FASTA format. For each cfDNA
    fragment, fRagmentomics outputs its size, its 3’ and 5’ sequences, and its
    mutational status.
